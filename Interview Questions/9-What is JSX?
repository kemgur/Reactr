What is JSX?
JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
It allows us to write HTML inside JavaScript and place them in the DOM without using functions like appendChild( ) or createElement( ).
As stated in the official docs of React, JSX provides syntactic sugar for React.createElement( ) function.
**Note- We can create react applications without using JSX as well.
Letâ€™s understand how JSX works:

Without using JSX, we would have to create an element by the following process:

const text = React.createElement('p', {}, 'This is a text');
const container = React.createElement('div','{}',text );
ReactDOM.render(container,rootElement);


Using JSX, the above code can be simplified:
const container = (
 <div>
   <p>This is a text</p>
 </div>
);
ReactDOM.render(container,rootElement);

As one can see in the code above, we are directly using HTML inside JavaScript.
